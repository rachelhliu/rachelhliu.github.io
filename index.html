        <h2>about me</h2>
        <p>
            hello world, im rachel. i recently graduated from the university of maryland,
            college park with a bachelor's degree in computer science and a minor in philosophy. 
            i love front end development but i have a ton of experience with back end as well. 
            i thrive in fast paced, collaborative environments and have a passion for turning ideas
            into working, polished products.
            <br>
            <br>
            outside of software development, you can find me playing volleyball or basketball, traveling, 
            or just hanging out with my dog, <a href="#" onclick="openImage()">moose</a>.

                <strong>TravelBuddy</strong><br>
                <p>
                    This was one of my favorite projects! It is an Android app that lets users share their favorite travel spots with friends, 
                    complete with ratings and a leaderboard for the most-loved destinations.I built it using Kotlin in Android Studio and hooked
                    it up to Firebase Realtime Database to keep everything in sync across devices. This project really sparked my interest in app
                    design; there's something so satisfying about creating an experience for user's that's both fun and functional.

            <li>
                <strong>Slimes Don’t Burn</strong><br>
                <p>
                    This was my first real experience with game development. Slimes Don't Burn is a chaotic, dungeon crawler style
                    game with air-hockey inspired physics. Built in Unity, this project taught me how to think like a game programmer: 
                    balancing mechanics, debugging collisions, and keeping gameplay fun. It was challenging and definitely made me reroute 
                    my brain - especially since I'm not much of a gamer - but that made the process even more rewarding.
                </p>

            <li>
                <strong>BIST</strong><br>
                <p>
                    BIST was one of my most technical deep dives. While interning at Intellian Technologies, I helped implement a built-in self-test (BIST) system for a flat panel 
                    antenna, working primarily in C and C++. The goal was to enable the antenna's processor to verify its own functionality without external tools. It pushed me to 
                    understand hardware-software integration on a deeper level and taught me a lot about working in real-world embedded systems with tight constraints and exacting 
                    requirements. Debugging was intense, but seeing the test work successfully for the first time? Super rewarding.

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>IModem</strong><br>
                <p>
                    IModem was a crash course in low-level communication protocols. I implemented XModem and YModem functionality to enable reliable file transfers on a Myir board 
                    using C and C++. It involved opening the correct serial ports, setting baud rates, and getting raw data to successfully send and recieve. This project taught me
                    a ton about how devices actually "talk" to each other and served as a hands-on introduction to the middle ground between software and hardware for someone coming
                    from a purely software-focused background.
